## Value Inc. Data Cleaning and Transformation using Python with Pandas ## 

Value Inc. is a retail store that sells household items all over the world in bulk.
The Sales Manager has no sales reporting, but he has a brief idea of current sales. 
He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit, and top-selling products. 
He wants a dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an Excel sheet.

The project begins with data cleaning and maniulation using Python with Pandas, 
followed by analyzing the data using Tableau.
