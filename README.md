### Value Inc. ### 

Value Inc. is a retail store that sells household items all over the world in bulk.
The Sales Manager has no sales reporting, but he has a brief idea of current sales. 
He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit, and top-selling products. 
He wants a dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an Excel sheet.
